"""Retry with backoff, deadline-aware and jittered.

Three decisions here are load-bearing.

**Full jitter, not fixed backoff.** `base * 2**attempt` alone synchronises
clients: everything that failed during one upstream blip retries at the same
instant, which is the blip's second wave. Full jitter — sleeping a uniform
random amount between zero and the computed ceiling — spreads that wave out. It
is measurably better than "exponential plus a bit of noise" under contention,
and it is the reason the RNG is injected: a jittered schedule that cannot be
made deterministic cannot be asserted on.

**The deadline outranks the schedule.** A policy that allows five attempts
inside a 10-second deadline must not sleep 32 seconds before attempt four. When
the next delay would not fit, the loop stops *now* and raises the failure it
already has, rather than sleeping through the deadline and raising a timeout
that hides the real cause.

**Only `retryable` errors are retried.** Not "any exception". A `KeyError` in a
response parser is a bug, and retrying it four times turns one stack trace into
four and delays the fix. Errors classify themselves (see errors.py); this module
just obeys.
