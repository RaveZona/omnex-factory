"""Running model-authored code without handing it the machine.

The honest framing first, because sandboxing is the area where confident
libraries do the most harm: **this is a resource and blast-radius limiter, not a
security boundary against a determined attacker.** A CPython interpreter in a
subprocess is not a hostile-code sandbox — CPython has never claimed to be one,
and every in-process "restricted exec" scheme built on stripping `__builtins__`
has been escaped, usually within a day, via the object graph
(`().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()` and relatives).

What this does provide is real and worth having:

- A separate process, so a segfault or `os._exit` takes nothing with it.
- OS-enforced limits via `setrlimit` — address space, CPU seconds, file size,
  process count. A fork bomb hits `RLIMIT_NPROC`; a `[0] * 10**10` hits
  `RLIMIT_AS` and raises `MemoryError` inside the child rather than invoking the
  kernel OOM killer on whatever else happens to be resident.
- A wall-clock kill, because `RLIMIT_CPU` does not fire on a process asleep in
  `time.sleep(10**9)`.
- No network, no environment, and a scratch working directory.

For genuinely untrusted code the answer is a VM or a gVisor/Firecracker
container, and `SandboxPolicy.network` refuses to be set to True here so that
choice cannot be made by accident in a config file.

The limits are applied in the child via `preexec_fn`, after fork and before
exec, which is the only point where they can be set for the child without
affecting the parent.
