"""Parse the Universal AI OS export into a committed manifest, and reconcile it.

    python scripts/ingest_atlas.py

The export is one 760 KB markdown file describing 509 figures extracted from
*AI Engineering: System Design Patterns for LLMs, RAG and Agents*, mapped onto
28 branches and 507 nodes. It arrived by hand because the host serving it is
refused by this environment's egress policy; the file is committed beside this
script so the parse is reproducible by anyone, from the same bytes.

## What is taken as evidence and what is not

Taken: figure counts per branch, bounding boxes, sha, duplicate groups, page and
chapter, OCR text, and the node names. Those are records of something somebody
extracted, and they can be checked against the source.

**Not taken: the n/10 completeness scores.** The system that wrote each node also
scored it, which is the frozen-criteria problem with the anchor removed — the
same reason `ontology_map.py` has no completeness score of its own. The export is
candid about this in its own numbers: 350 of its 509 mappings sit in the review
queue rather than auto-accept, so most of them are the author's judgement
awaiting a check, not a measurement.

## Why the reconciliation is the point

Neither document alone says anything useful about priority. The export knows
where the *field's* attention is — 70 figures on the protocol fabric, 123 on ML
foundation — and knows nothing about this repository. `ontology/branches.json`
knows what `engine/` actually implements and nothing about how much of the
literature each branch carries.

Joined, they answer a question neither can: **where does the corpus concentrate
while engine/ has nothing?** That is an argument from evidence rather than from
whoever wrote the roadmap, and it is the one number here worth acting on.
