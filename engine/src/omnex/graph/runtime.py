"""A small state-machine runtime for agent workflows.

Written rather than imported, for reasons that are about testability rather than
not-invented-here. LangGraph is a good library and there is an adapter for it in
`langgraph_adapter.py`; what this gives that pulling it in as a hard dependency
does not:

- The whole engine's test suite stays dependency-free and runs in seconds.
- Checkpointing is a first-class value type, so P15's pause/resume can be
  asserted on directly — a run interrupted at node 3 and resumed in a *different
  process* must produce the same result, and that is hard to test through an
  abstraction that owns its own persistence.
- Budget enforcement (steps, wall clock, spend) is inside the loop rather than
  bolted onto it, so a runaway graph stops with a stated cause.

The design is deliberately small: nodes are functions from state to a state
patch, edges are either static or a function of state, and the state is an
immutable mapping updated by merging patches. That is enough for every graph in
this repo, and it means a node is a plain function that a test can call directly
with a dict.

**Patches, not mutation.** A node returns what changed rather than editing the
state in place. That is what makes checkpointing cheap, what makes a step
replayable, and what stops the classic bug where a node mutates a list the
previous node still holds a reference to.
