"""The coverage map, held to the standard it claims to apply.

`ontology/branches.json` says which of the twenty-eight branches are already
backed by code. That claim decays silently: rename `omnex.memory.LongTermMemory`
and the map still reads "Agent Memory -> implemented", now describing a
repository that no longer exists. Nobody re-reads a coverage document to check
it, which is exactly why it needs a test rather than a review.

So the load-bearing test here is `test_every_claimed_symbol_still_resolves`. It
is the reason the map cannot rot: a refactor that moves a symbol turns CI red in
the same run that moved it, while the claim is still fresh in somebody's head.

The last test in the file deliberately builds a lying branch and asserts the
audit catches it. A guard nobody has seen fail is a guard nobody knows is wired
up — and that check is cheaper to keep here than to remember to run by hand.
