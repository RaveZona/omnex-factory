/**
 * P8 — streaming a run to a browser, with what it cost attached as it happens.
 *
 * The scan in `intel/` found that the fastest-growing project in the whole
 * agent ecosystem is a run visualiser: `patoles/agent-flow`, +64.1% over 82
 * days. It renders the SHAPE of a run — which step called what, in what order.
 * What it does not render is what any of it cost, and neither does anything
 * else in that scan: `citations`, `cost_optimization` and `observability` were
 * claimed by almost none of the projects with enough text to judge.
 *
 * `Trace` (lib/core/agents/trace.ts) already carries `costEur` per span. So the
 * only missing piece is a transport, and the product is the combination: a live
 * view where the expensive branch is visibly expensive WHILE it is still
 * running, rather than a bill at the end of the month.
 *
 * ## Four things a streaming endpoint gets wrong, handled here
 *
 * **A closed tab must stop the work.** This is the expensive one. HTTP
 * streaming does not notify the server that anyone is still reading; if nobody
 * wires the abort signal, a user who closes the tab leaves a run generating
 * tokens against their own balance with no one to show them to. `runEvents()`
 * takes an `AbortSignal` and checks it between steps, and `cancel()` on the
 * stream fires it — so a disconnect stops the spend rather than merely stopping
 * the display.
 *
 * **A terminal event is always emitted.** If a run throws, the client must be
 * told, or the UI spins forever on a request that ended a minute ago. Every
 * exit path here emits exactly one `done` — success, failure or abort — and the
 * test suite asserts it on all three.
 *
 * **Idle streams get killed by proxies.** A long tool call with no output looks
 * identical to a dead connection to every intermediary between here and the
 * browser. A comment heartbeat keeps it open and costs nothing.
 *
 * **Events carry no prompts and no customer data.** They carry span records,
 * whose `attrs` are already documented as "small, non-sensitive facts". A
 * streaming endpoint is the easiest place in a system to leak a prompt into a
 * browser log, so the payload is built from the span record rather than from
 * whatever the caller happened to have in scope.
 *
 * The wire format is Server-Sent Events, chosen over the Vercel AI SDK's client
 * runtime because it needs no dependency: this repository's rule is that the
 * core works on a bare install, and SSE is what the AI SDK is transporting
 * underneath in any case. A client written against either can read this.
