"""Verify the 28-branch ontology against the code that is supposed to back it.

    python scripts/ontology_map.py

A coverage map is worth exactly as much as its weakest claim. Typed by hand, the
row "Agent Memory -> omnex.memory" stays green through the refactor that renamed
every symbol in it, and the map becomes a document about a repository that no
longer exists. So nothing here is typed: `ontology/branches.json` supplies the
CLAIM, this script imports every module and resolves every symbol to decide the
STATUS, and a branch that names something absent fails the run.

That is also why there is no completeness score. The proposal this map answers
scored each node n/10 on ten dimensions — but the system that writes a node
would also be the system that scores it, which is `harness/contract.py`'s frozen
criteria problem with the anchor removed. Two binary facts replace it, and
neither is ours to grade: the symbol imports, or it does not; the test file is
on disk, or it is not.

## The verdict answers a narrower question than it looks like

For every branch with something still to build, `omnex.harness.worth_it`
supplies a verdict. That gate is about LOOPS — its conditions are Karpathy's
(does the task recur, can a machine fail the work, will the budget absorb the
waste, can the agent see what breaks) and autoresearch's (goal, method,
assessment). So the question it answers is:

    should an autonomous loop OWN this branch?

"NOT worth it" here means *do not point a loop at it*. It has never meant *do
not build it*, and a reader who takes it that way has been misled by this script
rather than by the gate.

Failures are collected and reported together rather than raised at the first
one, for the reason CLAUDE.md gives: being refused repeatedly, one condition at
a time, is how somebody concludes the check is the obstacle.
