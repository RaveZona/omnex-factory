"""Break the load-bearing rules on purpose. Every one must turn a test red.

    python scripts/mutate.py

"How many bugs are in it" has no honest integer, and inventing one is worse than
declining. What CAN be measured is the thing the question is really after: how
much of this codebase is actually held by its tests. Nine hundred green
assertions are evidence of nothing until breaking the code breaks them.

This is `test_the_round_trip_check_can_actually_fail` generalised. That test
breaks one emitter so the other fifteen are not comparing an artifact with
itself. The concurrency suite does the same by removing a lock and requiring the
loss. Both exist because the answer to "could this fail?" was once no, silently.
So the catalogue below asks it of every rule this repository considers
load-bearing, and a mutation that SURVIVES is a named hole with a file and a
line rather than a vague worry.

## Not a mutation-testing library

No `mutmut`, no dependency, and no attempt at coverage of every operator. A
random mutation of an arbitrary line mostly produces code that does not compile
or behaviour nobody promised, and the report is then dominated by noise a person
has to triage. Each entry here is hand-written against a rule the repository has
already paid for, and names the test that is supposed to catch it. Small and
argued beats large and unread.

## The working tree is never touched

Mutations are applied to a copy under a temporary directory. An in-place mutate
with a `finally` restore is one interrupt away from leaving a sabotaged file in
somebody's checkout, and the sabotage is designed to look plausible.
