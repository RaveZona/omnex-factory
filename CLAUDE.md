# OMNEX Factory

Two codebases in one repository. `engine/` is a zero-dependency Python AI
platform (18 production systems). The Next.js app at the root is the commercial
surface that sells access to them.

## The commands that gate a change

```bash
# TypeScript — root
npx tsc --noEmit && npx vitest run && npx next build

# Python — from engine/
.venv/bin/ruff check src tests scripts \
  && .venv/bin/ruff format --check src tests scripts \
  && .venv/bin/mypy \
  && .venv/bin/python scripts/invariant_map.py \
  && .venv/bin/python scripts/env_check.py \
  && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q \
  && .venv/bin/python scripts/mutate.py

# citegate — from oss/citegate/
../../engine/.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

**`ruff format --check` is not optional.** Omitting it locally is what turned CI
red at `01c73c8`; `ruff check` passes on code `ruff format` would rewrite. CI
(`.github/workflows/engine.yml`) runs it on Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13.

**This block is not documentation, it is an assertion.**
`engine/tests/test_ci_contract.py` reads it and requires CI to be a superset of
it. That test also catches the reverse failure, which had already happened: CI
ran `vitest run` against two hand-named files, one of which did not exist, so it
covered one suite of seven. Note its boundary honestly — it compares this block
with CI and cannot see a rule that is weak on *both* sides. `ruff format --check`
omitted `scripts` here and in CI, they agreed, and only reading them together
with fresh eyes found it.

Current state: **1,038 engine tests · 68 TypeScript · 16 citegate**, all green,
plus **15 of 15 mutations killed**.
All 68 TypeScript tests now run in CI; until this commit, seven of them did.

## engine/src/omnex/ — what each module is for

| module | what it does | the number it carries |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | Money (pico-dollars), Clock, errors, ids | — |
| `router` | cheap→verify→escalate routing | routed spend **42.4%** of always-strong at equal accuracy |
| `rag` | retrieval + page- and figure-anchored citations + grounding | **25–30k** sentences/sec, flat with document size |
| `vectors` | hybrid dense/lexical store, RRF | — |
| `guard` | injection fence, PII, rate limits, sandbox | **30/30** attacks, **1/30** false positives |
| `evals` | golden cases, metrics, regression gate | gates on newly-failing cases, not the mean |
| `crew` | multi-agent consensus, hash-chained audit | — |
| `hitl` | human approval bound to a fingerprint | — |
| `harness` | long-running loop: worth-it gate, contract, evaluator, edges, isolation, state, outer loop | outer loop watches **cost per accepted change** |
| `mcp` | JSON-RPC 2.0 tool protocol over a `Transport` Protocol | built because **62 of 509 figures** named it — the top of `BUILD_ORDER.md` |
| `factory` | spec · gates · compilers · per-run economics · portfolio · the loop back | `worth_it` at the head of ten stages; `parse(emit(bp)) == bp` across **3 targets × 5 paradigms**; margin per run in exact picos |

### Non-obvious invariants — breaking these is silent

**These are now checked, not asserted.** Each id below is an entry in
`engine/ontology/invariants.json` with a predicate behind it;
`scripts/invariant_map.py` runs them all and exits non-zero on any breach. Two
of the five defects found in the audit that produced this section were direct
violations of rules written right here, greppable in minutes, sitting untouched
because nothing grepped. A rule that is not in a gate decays at that rate.

- **Money is `int` pico-dollars (1e-12 USD).** Micro-dollars round cheap-model
  tokens to zero, so a router that saves money reports saving nothing. Never
  introduce a float currency path. → `money_is_int_picos`
- **Time comes from an injected `Clock`.** Nothing calls `datetime.now()` or
  `time.monotonic()` directly. `FakeClock` is why the suite asserts on hour-long
  TTLs and still runs in 7 seconds. → `time_is_injected` (two allowlisted files,
  each naming the parameter that already provides injection)
- **Zero required dependencies.** Heavy libraries (torch, transformers, pdf) sit
  behind Protocol adapters and are optional extras. A test must not need them.
  → `zero_required_dependencies`
- **`StrEnum` inherits `str` comparisons**, so `@total_ordering` fills in
  nothing. Any ordered `StrEnum` (e.g. `Tier`) must define all four comparisons
  explicitly. → `ordered_strenum_writes_all_four`
- **Symbol resolution has one implementation**, in `omnex.core.symbols`,
  imported by everything that asks whether a name exists.
  → `one_symbol_resolver`
- **The two sentence splitters must agree.** They are separate copies on purpose
  and have diverged twice. → `twin_splitters_agree`
- **A stated limitation is kept as a passing test.** `test_a_paraphrase_outside_
  the_corpus_is_missed` and the inverted-polarity grounding test are *supposed*
  to be green. Do not "fix" them; they are the honesty anchors.
  → `limitations_are_passing_tests`, declared **unenforceable**: a checker keying
  on test names would be satisfied by renaming one.
- **Refusals name every failing condition at once**, not the first.
  → `refusals_name_every_condition`, declared **unenforceable**.
- **Docstrings explain why and name the failure prevented.**
  → `docstrings_name_the_failure`, declared **unenforceable**: any mechanical
  proxy turns a convention into a quota.
- **A live listing may not promise more than QC passed.** The €49 Complete
  Vault sells "170+ images" against 80 in the manifests. Scoped to `live`
  offers — mirroring `registry.ts`'s `enabled` — because "you must have 170
  images" would be red until the day they exist, and a permanently red build is
  one people ignore. → `live_listings_are_covered`
- **An n8n binding names a credential and never carries one**, and may not claim
  confirmation without a person's name and a date. The emitted workflow JSON is
  committed and shared; a key in it is an incident, not a configuration.
  → `bindings_carry_no_credentials`
- **Suite fingerprints refuse cross-suite comparison.** Editing an expected
  answer and re-running is otherwise indistinguishable from an improvement.

## Root app — the money path

- `lib/core/llm/provider.ts` — `LlmResult` carries an optional `usage` block.
  **This is the keystone**: without it nothing downstream can compute cost, and
  the copilot's cost panel reads €0.00 on every real run (the bug fixed in
  `3766976`).
- `lib/core/agents/metering.ts` — `priceCall()` returns `estimated: boolean`.
  An estimate is never displayed as a measurement.
- `lib/core/agents/budget.ts` — `estimateCostEur()` checks `cache:` **before**
  the unknown-provider fallback, or the one free path bills at the most
  expensive rate.
- `lib/modules/registry.ts` — module manifests. **Rule: module N+1 does not
  open until module N has taken a real payment.** Only `studio` is live;
  everything else is `enabled: false` on purpose, and `lib/__tests__/metering.
  test.ts` asserts `liveModules()` is exactly `['studio']`.
- Billing on the copilot: charged **on completion, proportional to measured
  cost, floor 1 credit**. Settlement runs in `onSettled` and fires on success,
  error **and** abort — a run that spent money and failed is the one an operator
  most needs to see.

## Where things live

- `engine/suites/` — benchmark suites + `LEADERBOARD.md` (fingerprint `884533eb08028871`)
- `engine/scripts/skill_numbers.py` — **the only source** of every number the
  skills publish. Re-measures rather than restates.
- `engine/ontology/` — the branch map onto `engine/`. `branches.json` holds
  claims and contains **no figures**; `scripts/ontology_map.py` resolves every
  symbol to decide status and renders `COVERAGE.md`. A claim for code that does
  not import fails CI. **`source` is load-bearing**: `proposal` branches were
  written down before anyone looked, `corpus:` branches were read out of a
  document. A map of an assumed list can confirm every entry on it and still be
  missing the field — v1 said 10 gaps against 28 assumed branches, and reading
  one corpus added 10 more.
- `engine/ontology/invariants.json` — **this repository's own rules, as
  predicates.** What `ontology_map.py` does for branches, one level in:
  `scripts/invariant_map.py` runs every checker, renders `INVARIANTS.md`, and
  exits non-zero on a breach. **A rule with no checker AND no written reason one
  is impossible fails the script** — the mechanism that stops the registry
  becoming a second copy of this file. Currently **8 of 11 enforced**, 3 declared
  unenforceable with reasons, 2 allowlisted exceptions that each name a working
  injection point. Each bullet in "Non-obvious invariants" above cites its id,
  and a test requires that link in both directions.
- `packs/publish.py` — **the last step before money: the request that creates a
  listing.** It builds the request and, by default, does not send it. No
  endpoint is written into this repository — the storefront API shapes were not
  readable from the environment this was developed in, so `--send` requires
  `OMNEX_LEMONSQUEEZY_URL` / `OMNEX_ETSY_URL` from the operator and refuses by
  name without one. Five refusals, all reported **at once**: a pack that does not
  cover its listing, no built archive, no price, an unconfigured credential, and
  `--send` with no endpoint. A sixth guard is the `live` flag: publishing an
  offer whose flag is still false needs `--force-draft`, because going live is a
  person's decision and it is the one that starts `registry.ts`'s clock. Header
  **names** travel in the request, never values, so `--dry-run` output cannot
  leak a key. Price crosses as integer cents via `Decimal` — `float("19.99")*100`
  is `1998.9999999999998`, and rounding rescues it rather than the type doing so.
- `deploy/env.json` + `engine/scripts/env_check.py` — **which of the 28
  environment variables a deploy cannot run without, and why.** Almost all of
  them **fail closed**: `cron-auth` returns false when `CRON_SECRET` is unset,
  `isOwner` refuses below 16 characters, every Stripe route answers 503. Correct
  direction, invisible failure — the site is up, the pages render, the feature is
  never reachable. **7 required, 11 secret**, plus one `any_of` group ("an image
  model"), because no single provider key can be required and Studio with none of
  them is live, billable and unable to produce anything. Two modes: the default
  compares the manifest with every `process.env` in the code **in both
  directions** and never reads the environment (CI's mode, or it would be
  permanently red); `--runtime` is the operator's, on the host about to serve.
  **No value is ever printed** — a preflight that prints a key to a build log has
  copied the secret, not checked it. The n8n side is *derived* from
  `n8n_bindings.json` and deliberately not listed here.
- `engine/ontology/n8n_bindings.json` + `engine/scripts/n8n_bindings_check.py` —
  **what an n8n node actually is, as data a person confirms.** Branch XI's
  `missing` field named the gap in words: without endpoint, method and credential
  per tool, an emitted workflow imports as a wiring diagram. The emitter now
  binds from this catalogue and leaves `noOp` only where nothing is bound.
  Nothing in it is inferred — the open web is refused at this environment's
  proxy, so the Etsy and Lemon Squeezy shapes could not be read, and those two
  bindings carry the knowable parts (node type, method, credential name) with the
  url deliberately absent and a note saying why. `confirmed` means **a person
  imported it and n8n accepted it**; setting it needs `confirmed_by` and
  `confirmed_at`, exactly as `nodes.json` requires for symbol resolution.
  Currently **7 bindings, 0 confirmed · 4 node types, 0 confirmed** — the one
  figure here a script cannot flatter. `emit(..., require_confirmed=True)` is
  what a deploy path uses; building and reading by hand does not need it.
  A binding whose `source` is `this repository` names a command the checker
  **resolves** — module, `__main__`, subcommand, or a real `.py` path — because
  the first version of this catalogue named two modules that did not exist.
- `engine/src/omnex/pipeline/__main__.py` — the CLI an n8n `executeCommand` node
  runs: `verify` (signature, replay window, sender id; body on stdin) and `claim`
  (deliver once). **Exit codes are the interface**: `0` proceed, `1` refused,
  `3` already delivered. `3` is separate because a redelivery is the normal case,
  and collapsing it into the failure code teaches whoever watches the workflow to
  ignore failures. The secret is read from `OMNEX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and there is no
  `--secret` flag — argv is visible in `ps` and n8n writes the command it ran
  into its own execution log.
- `engine/src/omnex/pipeline/claim.py` — `Claims`, a directory with one file per
  event id, taken with `os.open(O_CREAT|O_EXCL)`. `IdempotencyStore` is a dict
  and is correct for a worker that stays up; an n8n node runs a command and the
  process exits, so a dict there starts empty on every redelivery and
  deduplicates nothing. Boundary stated in the module: one filesystem, and a
  claim is written **before** the work, so a crash leaves an event claimed and
  undelivered — the other direction charges the customer twice.
- `packs/listing.json` + `packs/listing_check.py` — **what a listing promises,
  as data, against what QC passed.** `GIG.md` sells the €49 Complete Vault as
  "170+ images"; the four QC manifests total **80**. Nothing connected the copy
  to the goods, so the only thing between that page and a live Etsy listing was
  somebody remembering. The check reads manifests rather than directories
  because `.gitignore` admits exactly one file back out of `packs/*/`
  (`!packs/*/manifest.json`) — the images live on the machine that made them.
  A bundle is measured against its members' **real** counts: the Vault promises
  170 and its packs promise 50+40+40+40 = 170, so promise-versus-promise agrees
  with itself while every pack is short.
- `BUSINESS.md` + `engine/scripts/business_map.py` — **the same mechanism as
  `INVARIANTS.md`, one level out.** Every figure derived: days since the first
  commit in THIS repository (a repo cannot see the work before it, and a number
  that quietly counts something else is worse than none), goods against the
  promise, what is live, and the ask log. **A missing revenue log renders as "0
  recorded, which is not 0 earned" — never €0.00.** It reads the repository and
  cannot see Stripe, Supabase, Etsy or Lemon Squeezy, and says so in its own
  last section; printing an unobservable as zero is the mistake `3766976`
  already paid for. Today: **day 37, 80 commits, 80 of 170 images through QC,
  0 listings live, 1 module enabled, no revenue log.**
- `packs/build_pack.py` — QC-passed images → a file Etsy can deliver. Four
  ratios **cropped from the centre, never padded**: a background scene with bars
  is not publishable, so losing edge pixels is the correct loss here. The zip is
  **deterministic** (fixed timestamps, sorted entries) so "is the file I uploaded
  the file I built" is a hash rather than trust. Two refusal layers, and the
  split is the point: CI can only compare the promise against the manifest,
  while this — on the machine holding the files — also catches a manifest entry
  with no image behind it. Pillow is imported inside the function, so the
  assembly logic where every refusal lives is testable without it.
- `engine/scripts/mutate.py` — **the honest answer to "how many bugs".** There
  is no integer for that. There is a measurable one for *how much of this is
  actually held by its tests*: fifteen hand-written mutations against rules the
  repo has already paid for, each naming the test that must go red. Currently
  **15 of 15 killed**. On its first run it was 11 — the survivor showed that
  `Run.margin` and `_summarise`'s total were independent paths that happened to
  agree, so changing one moved the median, p10 and worst while the total and the
  verdict stayed put. No dependency, no coverage threshold: a coverage gate
  invites padding, which is the Goodhart the whole `harness` is built against.
- `engine/ontology/nodes.json` — all **507 nodes** against exported symbols.
  Three claims: `gap` (no candidate), `proposed` (an alias that imports,
  unconfirmed), `implemented` (**a person agreed**). A machine proposes and
  verifies resolution; it may never decide two names mean the same
  capability. Four claims, not three: `rejected` (a human said no) exists
  because the first `refresh()` after `omnex.mcp` landed proposed `Code →
  omnex.mcp.ErrorCode`, which is wrong — and with nowhere to record that, the
  same wrong proposal returns on every run and the queue can only grow.
  `refresh()` may propose for a gap; `prune()` withdraws proposals the current
  rule would no longer make; neither may touch anything a human verified.
  **Containment runs one way**: a symbol more specific than the node can be its
  implementation (`MCP` → `McpClient`), one broader cannot — `omnex.factory.Tool`
  was proposed for fourteen different "Tool X" nodes at once before that rule
  landed. Pruning that noise raised the gap count from 447 to 464, which is the
  honest direction. Currently **464 gap · 43 proposed · 0 rejected · 0
  implemented**.
- `corpus/universal-ai-os/BUILD_ORDER.md` — the join, from
  `scripts/build_order.py`: every node with no code, ranked by how many figures
  name it. **Only direct lexical edges sort it.** Chapter-affinity edges
  outnumber them 736 to 550, so ranking on the total ranks on chapter size —
  ReAct (6 direct, 63 chapter) would beat Vector Search (22, 21). And `gap`
  means *no alias was proposed*, never *the capability is absent*: `Vector
  Search` is a gap while `omnex.vectors.HybridStore` is in the package, so a
  node whose branch already exports symbols gets `alias?` (go read that code
  first), and only a branch exporting nothing gets `build`. **The queue moves as
  code lands**: MCP led it at 62 figures until `omnex.mcp` was built, at which
  point branch XII began exporting, the node became `proposed`, and every other
  XII node went from `build` to `alias?`. `test_the_queue_moved_when_the_node_at_
  its_head_was_built` is the record of that; the head is no longer pinned by
  name, because pinning it is what made the first version brittle.
- `corpus/universal-ai-os/` — 509 figures from *AI Engineering* (Pachaar &
  Chawla), the committed source export beside them, and `RECONCILIATION.md`
  joining corpus weight against `engine/` coverage. `scripts/ingest_atlas.py`
  parses it and **asserts the export's own totals** — a regex matching 400 of
  509 writes a smaller manifest and raises nothing. The n/10 scores in that
  export are deliberately not imported: its author scored its own nodes.
- `engine/src/omnex/factory/` — a set of capabilities compiled into an
  `AgentSpec`: role, capabilities bound to symbols that must import, priced
  tools, memory and context policy, paradigm, eval suite, governance, failure
  modes, cost model. The spec is fingerprinted and derives a `harness.Contract`,
  so one rescoped after approval fails the next gate. `Stage` makes the gate
  order a type — `idea → market → unit economics → architecture → simulation →
  evaluation → security → deploy → observe → scale/kill` — and
  `Pipeline.advance()` refuses anything out of order. Only three gates can be
  decided from the spec (idea, unit economics, architecture); the rest take
  evidence a person supplies, because a spec must not grade its own market.
  **`Stage` is the `StrEnum` trap in the flesh**: inherited string comparison
  makes `Stage.DEPLOY < Stage.IDEA` true, and `@total_ordering` fills in nothing
  because all four operators are already inherited. They are written out.
- `engine/src/omnex/factory/compile/` — one neutral `Blueprint` (topology, never
  implementation) and three emitters: a runnable `graph.Graph`, an MCP server
  manifest, an n8n workflow JSON. **The property that makes them compilers is
  `parse(emit(bp)) == bp`**, checked across every target × paradigm, and
  `test_the_round_trip_check_can_actually_fail` breaks an emitter on purpose so
  the other fifteen are not comparing an artifact with itself. That matrix found
  a real bug: n8n read tool prices off tool *nodes*, so four of five paradigms
  lost every price and the workflow still imported. Prices now travel in `meta`.
  An n8n node is `noOp` and says **in its own `notes` field** that it is a
  placeholder whenever nothing in `n8n_bindings.json` binds its ref — a spec
  names a tool and its price, never the endpoint, credential or payload, and
  inventing those ships configuration nobody supplied. A bound node carries the
  real type and parameters and says in the same field whether anybody has
  imported it. **The omnex keys are merged last on purpose**: a hand-written
  parameter template that shadowed `omnexRef` would round-trip as a different
  topology while the workflow still imported, which is the one way the round-trip
  property could be defeated from the data side (`a_binding_may_shadow_the_
  reference` in `mutate.py`).
- `engine/src/omnex/factory/economics.py` — margin per run, per agent, per
  customer, in exact picos. **Acquisition is not a per-run cost**: charging it
  that way makes a customer look worse the more they use the product, so it is
  answered by `payback_runs()` instead. A failed run is costed and counted, or
  the cheapest agent is one that fails everything. Margin is reported as a
  distribution — `worst()` is the number that says "cap the loop", the mean is
  the number that says everything is fine. `is_losing_money()` is **three-valued**
  and answers `None` below `MINIMUM_RUNS`, like `router.break_even()`.
  `cost_drift()` compares what the gate approved (an estimate) against what
  happened (a measurement) — the `metering.ts` `estimated: boolean` rule again.
- `engine/src/omnex/factory/portfolio.py` — live agents as assets with one
  explicit decision each. **`recommend()` proposes, `enact()` records a person's
  name** — the node map's rule at the level where it costs most, because `KILL`
  is irreversible and is what an optimiser under cost pressure reaches for
  first. Three refusals: too few runs is `WATCH`; nothing is killed on a
  dimension nobody measured (`None` means unmeasured, never zero); `MERGE` comes
  from overlap across the portfolio. `report()` opens with **`n=1. This is not a
  portfolio yet`** whenever there are fewer than two assets.
- `engine/src/omnex/factory/feedback.py` — runs, compiler results and portfolio
  decisions become one stream `harness.meta.diagnose()` reads, and an accepted
  improvement writes back a node claim. **That claim is always `proposed` and
  there is no parameter that makes it `implemented`** — the thing producing the
  evidence does not grade it. A zero-cost observation is refused: cost per
  accepted change falls toward zero the more of them a loop emits, and that is
  the one number the outer loop cannot afford to have gamed.
  `test_the_chain_runs_from_spec_to_an_observation_the_outer_loop_accepts` walks
  the whole thing in one pass, so a decorative link fails.
- `skills/` — five packaged skills, each carrying its measured number
- `intel/` — committed scan snapshots and reports
- `oss/citegate/` — standalone, dependency-free citation checker
- `packs/` — image-generation job packs (separate concern from `engine/`)

## Conventions that are already decided

- Docstrings explain **why**, and name the failure the code prevents. Match the
  surrounding density rather than adding a house style.
- Refusals name every failing condition at once, not the first — being refused
  repeatedly is how somebody concludes the check is the obstacle.
- Prefer a structural fix to a tuned threshold. `Fleet.assign()` refuses
  overlapping workspaces rather than trusting workers to take turns.
- New measured claims go in `skill_numbers.py` first, then get quoted.

## Lab notes — mistakes already paid for, do not repeat

- `ruff check` passing does not mean `ruff format --check` passes. Run both.
- **A workflow's `paths:` filter is part of its gate.** `engine.yml` triggered on
  `engine/**` only, while the engine suite reads `packs/`, `lib/`, `app/`,
  `components/`, `oss/`, `corpus/`, `CLAUDE.md` and the workflows themselves. A
  change to any of those could not turn the job red, so the gate was green by not
  running. Widened, and the filter now names each reason.
- **`test_ci_contract` compared ruff's directories and nothing else.** A whole
  script added to CLAUDE.md's gate block and not to CI passed it untouched —
  which is the same drift it was built for, one level up.
  `test_ci_runs_every_gate_script_the_document_names` closes that half.
- **A catalogue entry is prose until something resolves it.** The first version
  of `n8n_bindings.json` shipped naming `python -m omnex.pipeline.verify_webhook`
  and `...seen_before`. Neither was a module. It passed every check written for
  it — the schema was valid, no secret was in it, the node type existed — because
  every one of those checks was about the entry's *shape*. An unresolvable
  command is worse than an unbound ref: the workflow imports, the node is not
  marked a placeholder, and nothing says otherwise until the first real order.
  `unresolved_commands()` now resolves every command claiming to be ours, and
  `test_a_command_naming_a_module_that_does_not_exist_is_caught` reproduces the
  exact three shapes that shipped.
- **A concurrency test written the obvious way passes without the lock.** At
  CPython's default 5ms switch interval, eight threads rarely interleave inside
  a short critical section, so the first version of `test_concurrency.py` was
  green against an unguarded `CostLedger` and proved nothing.
  `sys.setswitchinterval(1e-9)` plus 16×400 makes it unmistakable: the unlocked
  ledger reports **the right event count and half the money** ($0.29 of $0.64).
  The GIL narrows this window; it does not close it, and free-threaded CPython
  removes it.
- **Twins can diverge in their DATA while their code stays identical.** The two
  splitters were line-for-line equivalent and the engine's `_ABBREVIATIONS` had
  quietly grown by `dr.`/`mr.`/`ms.`, so citegate split "Mr. Lee and Ms. Park
  disagreed." into four fragments. Comparing the functions found nothing; only
  `test_citegate_parity.py`, running both over one corpus, did.
- **Symbol resolution lives in `omnex.core.symbols`, imported by everything.**
  `ontology_map.py`, `node_map.py` and `omnex.factory` all ask "does this name
  exist"; the splitter lesson below is what a second copy costs.
- A citation like `[url · 2026-08-05]` parses as the asserted figure "2026"
  unless citations are stripped *before* number extraction.
- Masking citations before sentence-splitting is required, **and** the restore
  must substitute only the placeholders a sentence contains — walking the whole
  citation list per sentence is O(n²) and cost 4.5s on a 4,000-sentence filing
  (fixed in `d8d3ca5`, guarded by a growth-ratio test).
- **That splitter exists twice.** `engine/src/omnex/rag/ingest.py` and
  `oss/citegate/src/citegate/grounding.py` are independent copies, on purpose —
  citegate ships dependency-free. The quadratic was fixed in the engine and
  survived in citegate for a further commit. Fix a splitter bug in both, or
  check the other before claiming it is fixed.
- **A benchmark whose shape cannot express a bug reports good numbers straight
  through it.** `bench.py` measured 5,000 answers of four sentences each, where
  the quadratic term is nothing, and published 46,279 sentences/sec while the
  same code did 1,439/sec on one long document. It now measures both shapes.
- A thin artifact (a 50-char PyPI summary) is not evidence of absence. The gap
  matrix excludes corpora under 200 chars and names them, because "nobody does
  model_routing" was nearly published about litellm, which *is* a router.
- The shell's cwd persists between calls and is often already `engine/`.
  `cd engine` then fails. Use absolute paths or check first.
- **The open web is not reachable — only an allowlist is.** Measured: PyPI, npm,
  crates.io, GitLab and Docker Hub answer, and GitHub arrives through the git
  lane (`add_repo`, then clone). Everything else — `example.com`,
  `wikipedia.org`, `vercel.com`, `lovable.app`, `drive.google.com` — gets
  `gateway answered 403 to CONNECT` and never opens a socket. The previous
  version of this note named four blocked hosts and what answers, which reads as
  "the rest is fine"; that omission cost a session, with three clients
  (WebFetch, curl, Chromium through the proxy) each refused identically before
  anyone thought to test `wikipedia.org` as a control. **Read
  `curl -sS "$HTTPS_PROXY/__agentproxy/status"` → `recentRelayFailures` before
  trying any host not on the list** — the proxy logs its own refusals, so one
  read replaces a round of guessing. A 403 there is an org policy decision:
  report it, never route around it. Content from a blocked host arrives by `@`
  upload or through a GitHub repo, and the network policy itself is the user's
  to widen at environment level.
- **A polling loop on a quiet resource fails this repo's own `worth_it` gate.**
  An hourly PR check-in ran ~30 times against a green, unchanged PR: `repeats`
  holds, `budget` does not — it spent every hour and shipped nothing, and
  `goal` does not, because no metric moved. Webhook subscription already wakes
  the session on real PR events, so the poll was redundant with a mechanism that
  costs nothing when nothing happens. Prefer the event; if a fallback is needed
  at all, make it daily.
