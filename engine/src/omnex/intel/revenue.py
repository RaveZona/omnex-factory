"""Revenue modelling in exact money, with the assumptions on the outside.

Every "market opportunity" slide in existence is a number with no derivation. The
number is usually right about direction and wrong by an order of magnitude about
size, and because the inputs are not written down nobody can find out which.

`Opportunity` takes the opposite approach: the inputs are the object, the
estimate is a computed property, and `explain()` prints both. If a reader thinks
the price is optimistic they change one field and see the payback move. That is
the only form of financial projection worth committing to a repository.

## Why `Money` rather than floats

`omnex.core.money.Money` is pico-dollar integers. Here the amounts are large
enough that float error would not change a decision — but mixing two money
representations in one codebase is how the small amounts, where it does change
decisions, eventually get computed in the wrong one. One representation.

## Payback, not revenue

`monthly_revenue` alone ranks a large slow-building product above a small
immediate one, which is backwards for a business that needs the next module to
fund the one after it. `payback_months` is the ranking field: build cost divided
by monthly margin, which answers "when does this stop costing us money" — the
question the sequencing decision actually turns on.
