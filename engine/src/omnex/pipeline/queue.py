"""Async work: idempotency, retries, and a dead-letter queue you can replay.

Four decisions, each closing a hole that shows up in production rather than in
a design review.

**An idempotency key covers the PAYLOAD, not just the key.** The usual
implementation stores seen keys and returns the cached result on a repeat. That
is right for a genuine retry and catastrophically wrong for a caller that reused
a key with a different body — an off-by-one in their loop, a stale variable —
because it silently returns the wrong answer for a request that was never
processed. So the payload hash is stored with the key and a mismatch is a
CONFLICT, loudly, rather than a cache hit.

**Delivery is at-least-once, so handlers must be idempotent, and this says so.**
Exactly-once delivery does not exist across a network. Pretending otherwise
pushes the duplicate handling into whichever handler forgets it.

**Dead letters keep everything needed to replay.** A DLQ holding only an error
message is a list of things you know broke and cannot retry. Each entry keeps
the original payload, every attempt's error, and the idempotency key — so a
replay after a fix is one call, and a replay of something already fixed is a
no-op rather than a double charge.

**Retry classification comes from the error, not the handler.** A `PermanentError`
dead-letters on the first attempt: retrying a malformed payload four times
produces four identical failures and delays the alert by the backoff schedule.
