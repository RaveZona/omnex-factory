"""The repository's own rules, as predicates instead of prose.

`ontology_map.py` does this for branches: a claim about code that does not
import fails CI. `node_map.py` does it for nodes: a machine may propose an alias
and may not decide two names mean the same thing. `factory.compile` does it for
compilers: `parse(emit(bp)) == bp`.

The one place the pattern was never applied is the place the rules actually live.
CLAUDE.md states 31 of them, 21 phrased as "never / must not / refuses", and
until this file none was checked. That is not a stylistic gap. Two of the five
defects found in the audit that produced this file — a float currency path in
the metrics export, and `time.monotonic()` in the sandbox — were direct
violations of rules written down in that document, greppable in minutes, and
sitting there because nothing greps.

## Where this lives, and why not in the package

The plan put these checkers in `omnex.core`. They are here instead, next to
`ontology_map.py` and `node_map.py`, because they never run at runtime: nothing
in the shipped library calls them, and putting them in `core/` would ship a
source scanner to every consumer for no benefit. `core.symbols.resolve` is in
the package because `factory.spec.audit()` genuinely calls it on a live spec.
These do not have that argument, and inventing one would be the wrong kind of
symmetry.

## What a checker is

A function taking no arguments and returning a list of `Violation`. No
exceptions, no printing, no exit codes — `invariant_map.py` owns all of that, so
a checker stays testable in one line and several checkers can report together.
Refusals name every failure at once for the same reason they do everywhere else
here: being refused one at a time is how somebody concludes the check is the
obstacle.
