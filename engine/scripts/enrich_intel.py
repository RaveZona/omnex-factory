"""Build the committed evidence file the reports are generated from.

    python scripts/enrich_intel.py

## Why the GitHub records are a literal in this file

`omnex.intel.sources` documents the measured network reality: from inside this
environment PyPI, npm, crates.io and Docker Hub answer, while GitHub, Hugging
Face, arXiv and HN return 403 at the proxy. GitHub evidence therefore cannot be
fetched by this script, and pretending otherwise would produce a script that
silently emits an empty evidence file on every run.

So the GitHub readings below were fetched out of band — by an agent with a
browser tool, on the date recorded in `FETCHED_ON` — and are transcribed here as
data. Each carries the URL it came from and a short attributed excerpt, which is
exactly what `Evidence` is for. A future run with GitHub credentials replaces
this literal with a `GitHubSource` adapter and nothing downstream changes.

Recording them as a literal rather than as prose in a report is the point: the
figures become checkable data that `report.verify_document` compares rendered
claims against, so a number that drifts between the evidence and the narrative
is caught mechanically.

## What the registry half does

Package registries ARE reachable, so `enrich_registries()` fetches them live.
Their `requires_dist` / `dependencies` lists are the architecture declared by the
author in machine-readable form, which is what `reverse.infer` reads. Failures
are collected and reported rather than raised — a scan that dies on one renamed
package has thrown away the other ninety-nine fetches.
