"""What an n8n node actually is, as data a person confirms — branch XI's gap.

`n8n.py` emits a workflow whose every node is `n8n-nodes-base.noOp`. That is the
honest artifact for a compiler with nothing to go on: an `AgentSpec` names a tool
and its price and says nothing about which endpoint it is, what credential it
uses or what body it posts, so a compiler that filled those in would be shipping
configuration nobody supplied. Branch XI records the consequence in its own
`missing` field — the workflow imports as a wiring diagram rather than running.

This is the thing that was missing, and it is deliberately **data, not code**.
The shapes n8n and a storefront expect cannot be verified from the environment
this repository is developed in; the open web is refused at the proxy. So no
shape is inferred here. Each one is written down, validated structurally, and
carries the one fact that matters about it:

## A binding is proposed until a person imports it

`confirmed` starts false and cannot be set by anything mechanical. Flipping it
requires `confirmed_by` (a name) and `confirmed_at` (a date), because the only
evidence that a node type and its parameters are right is that a real n8n
instance accepted them — and this process cannot perform that import. It is the
same rule `ontology/nodes.json` already runs on symbol resolution, one level out:
a machine may propose, only a person may verify.

## Credentials are named, never carried

A binding names a credential; it never holds one. The emitted workflow JSON goes
into a repository, and a key in it is an incident rather than a configuration.
`looks_like_a_secret` is run over every value on load AND over the whole emitted
document, because the two failures are different — a secret typed into the
catalogue and a secret that arrives through some other parameter path.

## One definition of a node type, not one per binding

`node_types` is separate from `bindings` for the same reason symbol resolution
has a single implementation: two bindings that each spell out `typeVersion` will
eventually disagree, and the disagreement is invisible in a diff of either one.
